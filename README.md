# HSI_classification-via-2D-3D-Conv-and-Hybrid-Net
## (1)HSI  classification via 2D Conv, 3D Conv and Hybrid Net

## (2)New hyperspectral images are generated by GAN and all details are shown in the Generate_data.ipynb file. 
After a series of attempts such as generating different sizes of images, 32x32x30, 64x64x3, 32x32x6, 32x32x3, 16x16x3 via GAN, I found that the 32x32x30 and 64x64x3 size of images perform better.

## 32x32x30
